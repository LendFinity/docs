# Tutorial

## How to Supply

1. Navigate to the "Supply" section.
2. Click on "Supply" for the asset you want to supply.
3. Select the amount you want to supply and submit your transaction\*.
4. Once the transaction is confirmed, your supply is successfully registered, and you begin earning interest.

\*Note: The first supply of an asset will require an additional approval transaction.

## Earnings Potential

#### How Much Will I Earn?

Holders of lTokens earn continuously, with earnings fluctuating based on market conditions:

* **Interest Rate Payments on Loans**: Suppliers share the interest paid by borrowers, calculated as the average borrow rate times the utilization rate. Higher reserve utilization results in higher yields for suppliers. For more details, refer to the borrow interest rate model spreadsheet.
* **Flash Loan Fees**: Suppliers receive a share of the Flash Loan fees, which is 0.09% of the Flash Loan volume.

Each asset has its own supply and demand market, with its own evolving APY (Annual Percentage Yield). You can view the average annual rate over the past 30 days to understand rate trends and find more detailed data in the reserve overview section of each asset in the app's home section.

## Supply Limits

#### Is There a Minimum or Maximum Amount to Supply?

There is no minimum supply amount. However, for very low amounts, transaction costs might exceed expected earnings, so consider this when supplying small amounts.

If a reserve has a supply cap, this limits the total amount of that asset that can be supplied. You can view current parameters and reserve states on the live dashboard.

## Borrowing Rates

#### Can I Borrow Using Stable and Variable Rates Simultaneously for One Asset?

No, you can only borrow using either a stable or variable rate. Switching to your desired rate will change the rate for your entire debt on that asset. However, you can have different borrow rates for different assets.

## Withdrawals

#### How Do I Withdraw?

1. Go to the "Dashboard" section.
2. Click on “Withdraw”.
3. Select the amount to withdraw and submit the transaction.

You can also use your lTokens as liquidity without withdrawing. Ensure there is enough liquidity (unborrowed) to withdraw. If not, you will need to wait for more liquidity from suppliers or borrowers repaying.

## Collateral Options

#### Can I Opt-Out My Asset from Being Used as Collateral?

Yes. After supplying your assets, you can deselect the asset to prevent it from being used as collateral. This opt-out option is available in the "Supply" section of your dashboard. Simply toggle the "use as collateral" button off for the asset you wish to opt-out.

\*Note: You can withdraw your assets without opting out of using them as collateral, provided those funds are not actively being used to borrow, and the withdrawal would not trigger a liquidation of your loans.
