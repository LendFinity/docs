## Problem

Internet Computer (ICP) is one of the most technically advanced and biggest L1 blockchains. Despite this, only 1% of its market cap is engaged in DeFi. This gap is largely due to ICP’s lack of DeFi protocols, particularly a lending protocol, which prevents holders from unlocking additional value from their assets.

## Solution

The success of DeFi on EVM-compatible chains demonstrates a clear path forward. With the launch of Bitfinity, an EVM-compatible Layer 2 on ICP, there’s now an unprecedented opportunity to bring DeFi to the ICP ecosystem. Lendfinity is designed to leverage this, drawing on Aave’s proven lending model to enable ICP and Bitcoin token holders to participate in secure, decentralized lending and borrowing.

## Objective

Our goal is to become the backbone of ICP's DeFi ecosystem, driving up TVL and empowering ICP and Bitcoin holders with new financial tools. By building a secure, user-friendly lending protocol, Lendfinity aims to expand the DeFi landscape within the Internet Computer ecosystem and unlock liquidity for ICP's native assets and Bitcoin Runes.

## Key Features
